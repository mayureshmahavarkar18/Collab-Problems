## Problem description:
You are given two coordinates start coord and end coord:
- For Level-1: You have to print a list of shortest path(any shortest path) coords we can take in order to reach start to end in 2D plane.
- For Level-2: You have to print a list of shortest path(any shortest path) coords we can take in order to reach start to end in 3D plane.
- For Level-3: You have to print a list of all the possible shortest paths for 2D coords.
